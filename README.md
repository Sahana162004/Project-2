Introduction:
	This project implements a real-time virtual background replacement system using a green screen technique. The application captures video input from a webcam, detects the green background using color segmentation in the HSV color space, and replaces it with a user-defined image or video. The goal is to simulate a professional background environment for video calls, recordings, or presentations using simple computer vision techniques.
Features:
  o	Real-Time Video Processing: Captures and processes live webcam footage.
  o	Green Screen Detection: Isolates the green-colored background using HSV-based segmentation.
  o	Background Replacement: Replaces green areas with a custom background image or video.
  o	User Interaction: Easily exit the app with a key press (q).
  o	Customizable: Green screen range and background can be customized for various lighting conditions.
Usages:
  o	Virtual Meetings: Add professional or branded backgrounds in real time.
  o	Online Education: Teachers can overlay themselves on slides or whiteboards.
  o	Content Creation: YouTubers or streamers can use this for storytelling or reactions.
  o	Media Production: Useful for shooting scenes requiring background changes in post.
